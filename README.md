# emails_sent fields -> id, email_address, ip_address, browser_info, created
# emails_sent.sql is used to log information.

# email_throttle field -> throttled
# email_throttle.sql contains all data, and is used as an outstanding simple finite measure that could be accessible by other high-level processes.

# Kudos and professional connections are appreciated :)
